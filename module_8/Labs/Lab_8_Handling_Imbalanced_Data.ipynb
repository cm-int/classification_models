Build a Random Forest model to classify an imbalanced dataset without making any modifications.\n","1. Examine the results and evaluate the performance using appropriate metrics.\n","1. Use sampling to balance the dataset and rebuild and retest the model.\n","1. Use bagging with sampling and rebuild and retest the model.\n","1. Use boosting with sampling and rebuild and restest the model.\n","1. Calibrate the model and restest it.\n","1.

Combine models using a VotingClassifier and evaluate the results.\n","\n","## Scenario\n","\n","Diabetes is among the most prevalent chronic diseases in the United States, impacting millions of Americans each year and exerting a significant financial burden on the economy.\n","\n","Complications like heart disease, vision loss, lower-limb amputation, and kidney disease are associated with chronically high levels of sugar remaining in the bloodstream for those with diabetes. While there is no cure for diabetes, strategies like losing weight, eating healthily, being active, and receiving medical treatments can mitigate the harms of this disease in many patients. Early diagnosis can lead to lifestyle changes and more effective treatment, making predictive models for diabetes risk important tools for public and public health officials.\n","\n","The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. Established in 1984 with 15 states, BRFSS now collects data in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories. BRFSS completes more than 400,000 adult interviews each year, making it the largest continuously conducted health survey system in the world.\n","\n","The dataset contains the following columns:\n","\n","Input variables:\n","* HighBP. 0=no high BP, 1=high BP\n","* HighChol. 0=no high cholesterol, 1=high cholesterol\n","* CholCheck.
