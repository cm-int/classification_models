# Machine Learning Fundamentals Part I - Classification Models

This repository contains the lab instructions, demonstration scripts, Python notebooks, and data for the course Machine Learning Fundamentals Part I - Classification Models.

The Python notebooks are designed to be run using the Google Colab environment.

## About the Course

This five-day instructor-led course is intended for IT professionals who wish to learn the fundamental principles of machine learning classification models. Students are typically developers or data analysts that have some programming skills, with a mathematical background. In this course, students will learn about classification machine learning models together with the algorithms that underpin these models.  Students will also learn about the need for data quality, and how the correct selection of data can help to build more accurate models. Students will also learn how to test and validate models.

This course is generic, and doesnâ€™t depend on any particular platform (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud etc), but does require some basic familiarity with Python. Students should also be familiar with the use of matrices and vectors in algebra, and have some basic understanding of differential calculus, probability and statistics.

**Note:** This course focusses on classification models. Two further courses cover cluster models and regression models. This course does not cover deep learning or neural networks, although the elements of this course can provide a foundation for further study in those areas.


## Audience

This course is intended for developers and analysts who are new to machine learning, want to understand how machine learning models work, and need to understand how to build high-quality models. Attendees must have some familiarity with Python, an understanding of matrix and vector arithmetic and some basic familiarity with probability, statistics, and differential calculus. 

## At Course Completion

After completing this course, students will be able to:

- Explain the uses of different types of machine learning models (classification, clustering, and regression).
- Understand common machine learning classification algorithms.
- Create and test a classification machine learning model.
- Create non-binary classification models.
- Summarize the statistical concepts utilized by many machine learning models.
